## Key idea 
- Let's modularize the code to improve maintainability.
- build a functioning scheduler based on this modular structure,
run it to produce actual results, and finally, compare and visualize the outcomes.

## Progress

- Scheduler Refactor â€“ Modularized the scheduler into four interchangeable components:
ComboGenerator, MetricEvaluator, TaskSelector, and Dispatcher.
These can be swapped dynamically via command-line configuration.
- Baseline scheduler
- OR-tools scheduler
