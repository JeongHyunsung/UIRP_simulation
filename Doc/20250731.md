## Key idea 
- we can’t afford to run a physical GPU cluster
- emulate one as faithfully as possible in code and search for optimal policies through simulation.

The sandbox reproduces on‑the‑ground bottlenecks—file transfer, heterogeneous GPU throughput, spot availability, pricing, budgets, hard deadlines—so that scheduling strategies can be designed, A/B‑tested, and refined entirely offline.

## Progress

- Scheduler Refactor – Modularized the scheduler into four interchangeable components:
ComboGenerator, MetricEvaluator, TaskSelector, and Dispatcher.
These can be swapped dynamically via command-line configuration.
- Baseline scheduler
- OR-tools scheduler

## Roadmap

### Hybrid CP‑SAT Scheduler
Investigate extensions of the current CP‑SAT formulation to incorporate soft constraints, penalty terms, and custom heuristics. Experiment with solution quality vs. runtime tradeoffs.
